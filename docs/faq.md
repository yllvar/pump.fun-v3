# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the Pump.fun API?
The Pump.fun API provides programmatic access to token data, trades, and wallet information from the Pump.fun platform.

### Is the API free to use?
Yes, the API is currently free to use, but please be mindful of rate limits.

### Do I need an API key?
No API key is currently required as most endpoints are publicly accessible.

## Rate Limiting

### What are the rate limits?
- 60 requests per minute per IP address
- Additional limits may apply to specific endpoints

### What happens if I exceed the rate limit?
You'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response headers will include information about when you can retry.

### How can I handle rate limits in my code?
Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic. Here's an example in Python:

```python
import time
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

session = requests.Session()
retries = Retry(
    total=5,
    backoff_factor=1,
    status_forcelist=[429],
    allowed_methods=["GET"]
)
session.mount('https://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))
```

## Data and Responses

### What format are the timestamps in?
Timestamps are typically in Unix epoch time (seconds since January 1, 1970).

### How can I convert timestamps to readable dates?

#### Python
```python
import datetime
timestamp = 1641234567
print(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp))
```

#### JavaScript
```javascript
const timestamp = 1641234567;
console.log(new Date(timestamp * 1000).toISOString());
```

### Why am I getting empty responses?
- The requested data might not exist
- You might be hitting rate limits
- The endpoint parameters might be incorrect

## Authentication

### Do I need to authenticate?
Most endpoints don't require authentication, but this might change in the future.

### How do I handle authentication if it's required in the future?
Store your API key in environment variables and use them in your requests:

```python
import os
import requests

api_key = os.getenv('PUMPFUN_API_KEY')
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
response = requests.get('https://api.pump.fun/endpoint', headers=headers)
```

## Common Issues

### I'm getting a 404 error
- Check that the endpoint URL is correct
- Verify that any required parameters are included
- Ensure you're using the correct HTTP method (GET/POST)

### The API is responding slowly
- The service might be experiencing high load
- Check your internet connection
- Try reducing your request rate

### How do I report a bug or request a feature?
Please open an issue in the GitHub repository with details about the bug or feature request.

## Best Practices

### How should I handle API changes?
- Monitor the repository for updates
- Implement versioning in your client code
- Test your application after API updates

### How can I reduce the number of API calls?
- Implement client-side caching
- Use pagination parameters effectively
- Only request the data you need

### What's the best way to store API responses?
- Use a database for persistent storage
- Implement caching with appropriate TTL
- Consider using a message queue for high-volume applications

## Troubleshooting

### I'm getting SSL certificate errors
- Ensure your system's CA certificates are up to date
- If testing locally, you might need to disable SSL verification (not recommended for production)

### The API returns unexpected data
- Check the API documentation for the expected response format
- Verify your request parameters
- The API might have been updated - check for any announcements

### How can I monitor my API usage?
- Keep track of the number of requests you make
- Monitor for rate limit headers in responses
- Consider implementing logging for all API calls
